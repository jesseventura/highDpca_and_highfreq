### Two topics are discussed in this project:
  1. High-dimensional PCA for modern linear asset pricing. Discussions on how to statistically determine 
  the number of significant factors given training set;
  2. High-frequency statistics and jump estimating. Implemented a jump test statistic using local volatility,
  e.g. 1-day volatility on 5-minute training set for weekly volatility mapping.
