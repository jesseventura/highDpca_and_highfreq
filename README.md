### Two topics are discussed in this project:
  1. High-dimensional PCA for modern linear asset pricing. Discussions on how to statistically determine 
  the number of significant factors given training set. Methods implemented: 
  * [Bai and Ng, 2002](http://www.econ.nyu.edu/user/baij/econometrica02.pdf);
  * [Ahn and Horenstein, 2013](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3982/ECTA8968/abstract);
  * [Onatski, 2010](http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/REST_a_00043);  
  2. High-frequency statistics and jump estimating. Implemented a jump test statistic using local volatility,
  e.g. 1-day volatility on 5-minute training set for weekly volatility mapping.
